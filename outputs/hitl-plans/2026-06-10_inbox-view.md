# HITL Plan: Inbox View for org-gtd config

**Created:** 2026-06-10
**Repo:** `~/.emacs.d` (source of truth: `config.org`; `config.el` is the tangled artifact via `org-babel-load-file`)

---

## Context & Locked Design (from grill-me)

Build a new **Inbox View** that mirrors the existing **Someday View** (`tdw-someday-priority-view`), with one new requirement: a prominent banner on all 4 views.

**Locked decisions:**

- **Marker:** inbox items carry `ORG_GTD="Inbox"` — a true peer to `"Someday"`/`"Actions"`. The view filters `tags-todo` on `ORG_GTD="Inbox"`.
- **Sections:** clone the **Someday** view's section set (tiers On Fire → Bells → On Deck → Recently Considered → Paused → Flyby, Big Rocks, Quick Wins, Other Rocks, Unestimated, Toggl Projects). Identical styling (prefix, effort + urg/imp annotation, hidden tag markers).
- **TODO keyword:** inbox items use the `TODO` keyword so `tags-todo` blocks reliably match them (the view hides the keyword via `org-agenda-todo-keyword-format ""`, so display is unchanged).
- **Banner (style A) on ALL 4 views** (Inbox / Someday / Unordered / Ordered), replacing the current one-line `📋 … View — Total Effort: …` title:
  ```
  ═══════════════════  📥  INBOX VIEW  ═══════════════════
  Total Estimated Effort: 2:15
  ```
  Per-view icons: 📥 Inbox, 💤 Someday, 📋 Unordered, 🎯 Ordered. Distinct face. Second line label is `Total Estimated Effort:` (renamed from `Total Effort`).
- **File:** reuse the existing org-gtd `inbox.org` (`org-gtd-inbox-path`, in `org-gtd-directory`). Add it to `org-agenda-files`.
- **Population:** primarily a future LLM workflow command (singly or en masse) emitting the item-format contract below. `C-c d c i` manual capture kept as a rare fallback, stamping `ORG_GTD="Inbox"`.
- **Item-format contract** (for the LLM workflow):
  ```org
  * TODO <title>                                   :tag1:tag2:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ORG_GTD:  Inbox
  :CREATED:  [timestamp]
  :END:
  ```
  Only `ORG_GTD: Inbox` is required. Optional: tags (route into tier/Toggl sections), `EFFORT`, `score_NN`, tier tags (`on_fire`…). Bare titled `TODO` items land in "Unestimated".
- **Grooming:** existing `s`/`n`/`x` agenda keys work unchanged — `tdw/agenda-move-to-someday` / `-to-next` read the current `ORG_GTD`, flip it, and refile out of `inbox.org` into `org-gtd-tasks.org`. Inbox empties as it's groomed.
- **Effort-scanner guard:** `tdw/get-sanity-effort-totals` counts NEXT/TODO across all agenda files without filtering `ORG_GTD`, so it must **skip `ORG_GTD="Inbox"`** to avoid inflating the other views' totals. (The unestimated counters already filter by `ORG_GTD=Actions`/`=Someday`, so they're unaffected.)
- **Keys:** `C-c d i` opens the view; sticky dispatch key `"i"` (Someday is `"S"`, Unordered `"u"`).

**Grounding facts:**
- Load path: `init.el` → `(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org")`. Editing `config.org` then tangling regenerates `config.el` (tracked artifact).
- No `CLAUDE.md` / `verify-plan.sh` in this repo; use `scripts/check-elisp-parens.sh` + a batch-load test for syntax verification.
- Live `.org` data lives on another machine (`thecleverone`/`my-venndoor-life`) — runtime behavior verified by the human at Step 11.

## Steps

- [x] **Step 1 — [COMPUTER] Research: confirm config structure & anchor points** _(read-only)_ — `no file changes`

  Confirm the exact line anchors to edit in `config.org`: `org-agenda-files` list, `tdw-someday-priority-view`, `tdw/get-someday-unestimated-count`, `tdw/get-sanity-effort-totals`, `tdw/update-sanity-view-headers`, the `:bind` block, and `org-gtd-capture-templates` usage. No file changes — `no file changes`.

  **✅ Result:** Anchors confirmed:
  - `org-agenda-files` seq-filter list: `config.org` lines 714–719 (hardcoded per-life-area `org-gtd-tasks.org` paths, guarded by `file-exists-p`).
  - `tdw/get-someday-unestimated-count`: lines 1708–1727 — compares `(org-entry-get (point) "ORG_GTD")` to `org-gtd-someday`. Clone target for inbox counter.
  - `tdw/get-sanity-effort-totals` lambda: lines 1033–1045 — filters `(member todo '("NEXT" "TODO"))`, **no `ORG_GTD` filter** → confirms inbox-guard needed (Step 6).
  - `tdw-someday-priority-view`: lines 1758–1863 — buffer `*Org Agenda(S)*`, dispatch key `"S"`, blocks filter `ORG_GTD="Someday"`, calls `tdw/get-someday-unestimated-count`.
  - `tdw/update-sanity-view-headers`: lines 1117–1218 — detection `or` at 1123–1137; per-view title rewrites at 1140–1150 (Ordered 1141–1142, Unordered 1145–1146, Someday is matched as a view by name but its title isn't separately rewritten — uses construction name).
  - `:bind` block: lines 743–757 (`C-c d S`, `C-c d u` present).
  - `org-gtd-capture-templates`: **not set in config.org** → user runs org-gtd defaults (`"i"` Inbox `* %?`, `"l"` link). Step 9 adds an override.

  **📎 Transcript:** Ran greps/seds over `config.org` to read the someday counter, the effort-totals `org-map-entries` lambda, and to confirm `org-gtd-capture-templates` is unset.

  **📝 Learned:** The Someday view's title is set at construction (the `(name . ...)`) and the finalize hook only rewrites Ordered/Unordered titles explicitly — so the banner step must add explicit handling for Someday and Inbox, not assume the hook already covers them.

---

- [x] **Step 2 — [COMPUTER] Add `inbox.org` to `org-agenda-files`**

  In `config.org`, append the org-gtd inbox path to the `org-agenda-files` seq-filter list so the inbox view (and grooming) can see inbox items.

  - [x] Add the inbox path to the list (kept safe by the existing `file-exists-p` filter)
  - [x] Commit — sha `59c9ef9`

  **✅ Result:** Added `"/Users/thecleverone/my-venndoor-life/orgnotes/gtd/inbox.org"` as the first entry of the `org-agenda-files` quoted list (`config.org:715`).

  **📎 Transcript:** **Deviation from plan:** the list is a *quoted* literal (`'(...)`), so `(expand-file-name "inbox.org" stag-org-gtd-directory)` would not be evaluated. Used a literal absolute path matching the existing entries' style instead. Path = `org-gtd-directory` (`~/my-venndoor-life/orgnotes/gtd`) + `inbox.org`, i.e. `org-gtd-inbox-path`. Guarded by the existing `file-exists-p` seq-filter.

  **📝 Learned:** All agenda paths are hardcoded under `/Users/thecleverone`; the inbox sits in the same venndoor gtd dir as the primary tasks file.

---

- [x] **Step 3 — [COMPUTER] Add `tdw/get-inbox-unestimated-count`**

  Clone `tdw/get-someday-unestimated-count`, swapping `ORG_GTD=Someday` → `ORG_GTD=Inbox`. Used for the Inbox view's Unestimated header.

  - [x] Define the new function next to the someday counter
  - [x] Commit — sha `c-step3`

  **✅ Result:** Added `tdw/get-inbox-unestimated-count` immediately after `tdw/get-someday-unestimated-count` (`config.org` ~1729). Identical body, comparing `ORG_GTD` to the literal `"Inbox"` instead of `org-gtd-someday`. Commit also carries the Step 2 sha correction (`59c9ef9`).

  **📎 Transcript:** Straight clone with the property-value swap; reused `tdw/get-effort-minutes` for the no-effort test.

  **📝 Learned:** Counter compares to the literal `"Inbox"` (no `org-gtd-inbox` constant exists for the *category* — `org-gtd-inbox` in org-gtd is the inbox *filename* base, not an ORG_GTD value).

---

- [ ] **Step 4 — [COMPUTER] Add `tdw-inbox-view` function**

  Clone `tdw-someday-priority-view`. Changes: buffer `*Org Agenda(S)*`→`*Org Agenda(i)*`; all block filters `ORG_GTD="Someday"`→`ORG_GTD="Inbox"`; name `Someday View`→`Inbox View`; unestimated count call → `tdw/get-inbox-unestimated-count`; dispatch key `"S"`→`"i"`.

  - [ ] Define `tdw-inbox-view`
  - [ ] Commit — sha `___`

---

- [ ] **Step 5 — [COMPUTER] Bind `C-c d i` → `tdw-inbox-view`**

  Add the keybinding to the `org-gtd` `use-package` `:bind` block (alongside `C-c d S` / `C-c d u`).

  - [ ] Add `("C-c d i" . tdw-inbox-view)`
  - [ ] Commit — sha `___`

---

- [ ] **Step 6 — [COMPUTER] Guard `tdw/get-sanity-effort-totals` against `ORG_GTD="Inbox"`**

  In the `org-map-entries` lambda, skip entries whose `ORG_GTD` is `"Inbox"` so inbox items never inflate the Ordered/Unordered/Someday effort totals.

  - [ ] Add the `ORG_GTD="Inbox"` skip guard
  - [ ] Commit — sha `___`

---

- [ ] **Step 7 — [COMPUTER] Add `tdw/format-view-banner` helper**

  New helper returning the 2-line **banner A** as a propertized string: a full-width rule line with centered `<icon>  <NAME> VIEW`, plus a second line `Total Estimated Effort: H:MM`. Distinct face for prominence.

  - [ ] Define `tdw/format-view-banner` (args: view-name, icon, effort)
  - [ ] Commit — sha `___`

---

- [ ] **Step 8 — [COMPUTER] Render banner in `tdw/update-sanity-view-headers` for all 4 views**

  Replace the per-view one-line title rewrites (Ordered/Unordered/Someday, and add Inbox) with banner-A rendering via `tdw/format-view-banner`, keyed off each view's detected name. Relabel effort line to `Total Estimated Effort:`. Add `Inbox View` to the view-detection branch at the top of the function. Icons: 📥/💤/📋/🎯.

  - [ ] Add `Inbox View` to the detection `or` clause
  - [ ] Replace title rewrites with banner rendering + `Total Estimated Effort`
  - [ ] Commit — sha `___`

---

- [ ] **Step 9 — [COMPUTER] Stamp `ORG_GTD="Inbox"` in capture templates**

  Override `org-gtd-capture-templates` (the `"i"` Inbox and `"l"` link templates) so manually-captured items get `* TODO …` + `:ORG_GTD: Inbox:` property. Keeps the `C-c d c i` fallback consistent with the LLM contract.

  - [ ] Set `org-gtd-capture-templates` with the stamped templates
  - [ ] Commit — sha `___`

---

- [ ] **Step 10 — [COMPUTER] Tangle, paren-check, batch-load, commit `config.el`**

  Regenerate the tracked artifact and verify syntax.

  - [ ] `emacs --batch --eval '(progn (require (quote org)) (org-babel-tangle-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org"))'`
  - [ ] `scripts/check-elisp-parens.sh config.el` (or batch `--eval` read-check) — confirm balanced parens
  - [ ] Batch-load smoke test: `emacs --batch --eval '(check-parens)'` on `config.el` (or load with `-q` guard) — no errors
  - [ ] Commit regenerated `config.el` — sha `___`

---

- [ ] **Step 11 — [HUMAN] Verify in live Emacs**

  In a running Emacs:
  - [ ] `C-c d i` opens the Inbox View with banner A (`📥 INBOX VIEW`, `Total Estimated Effort:`)
  - [ ] Banner A renders on Someday (💤), Unordered (📋), Ordered (🎯) too
  - [ ] Capture a test item via `C-c d c i` → appears in Inbox View
  - [ ] `s` / `n` / `x` groom it out; item leaves the inbox and lands in Someday/Actions/Cancelled
  - [ ] Unordered/Someday/Ordered effort totals unchanged by the presence of inbox items

---

- [ ] **Step 12 — [COMPUTER] Capture Context**

  Append a complete resumption block: every commit SHA, every decision, exact commands, any deviations.

---

- [ ] **Step 13 — [COMPUTER] Extract chat transcript**

  Append the full human-readable grill-me conversation that produced this design.
